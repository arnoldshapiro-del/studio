# Simple Instructions to Get Your Code on GitHub

You're almost there! This is the final step to copy all your code into the GitHub repository you just created.

**Instructions:**

1.  Open the terminal in this development environment if it's not already open.
2.  Copy the commands below, one at a time, and paste them into the terminal. Press `Enter` after each one.
3.  When you get to the command that says `PASTE_YOUR_GITHUB_URL_HERE`, replace that text with the actual URL you copied from the GitHub website.

### **Commands to Copy and Paste:**

**Command 1: Initialize the project**
```
git init -b main
```

**Command 2: Add all files**
```
git add .
```

**Command 3: Save a snapshot of your work**
```
git commit -m "Initial commit of my WellTrack Daily app"
```

**Command 4: Connect to your GitHub repository**
*Remember to replace the placeholder with your real GitHub URL!*
```
git remote add origin PASTE_YOUR_GITHUB_URL_HERE
```
*(Example: `git remote add origin https://github.com/your-username/my-welltrack-app.git`)*


**Command 5: Push your code to GitHub**
```
git push -u origin main
```

After running the last command, GitHub might ask for your username and password. For the password, you'll need to use a **Personal Access Token**. You can generate one in your GitHub account's developer settings.

Once that's done, you can refresh your GitHub page, and all of your project files will be there!
